# @react-appkit/sdk

This library provides public APIs to assist in developing applications using React AppKit.

The key distinction between this library and the runtime is that this library is intended for direct use by app developers, while the runtime is designed for internal use only and isn't available to app developers.

## Project Structure
The project comprises multiple entry points, each exporting a unique set of APIs. To explore these, please consult the inline JSDoc documentation for each module, located in the "src" folder.

## Build Output
No build step is required; this library is designed to be used directly in app code and is built and bundled alongside the app.
